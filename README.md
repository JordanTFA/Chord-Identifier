# Chord-Identifier

The objective of the chord identifier is to make use of machine learning to identify a chord or note played on a musical instrument, focusing on guitar and keyboard.

The software will also identify is the chord is being strummed upwards or downwards.

# Long-term goal

The current goal is for the software to be able to hear a song start to finish of just the instrument, and produce the chords and strumming pattern of that song.

# Final Goal

The final objective is similar to the long term goal, but to also be able to do so with other instruments being played.
